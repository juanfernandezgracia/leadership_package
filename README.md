# Leadership_KS

This package encapsulates the functions needed to apply the method described in [Ref to paper]. The package is structured into two parts: one which encodes the function for getting the follower-followee networks from presence point data of multiple individuals at the same location, and one which contains generators for different types of models of point processes to test the measure.
